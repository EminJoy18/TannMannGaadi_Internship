# TannMannGaadi_Internship
All my tasks throughout my tenure of internship at Tann Mann Gaadi, a "Not for Profit" trust venture building "Wellness on Wheels" to address the serious problem of open defecation, a major health risk for all in developing countries.
All my tasks in the path of building a Consulting GPT for the Company.
